\f0\fs24 \cf0 Project: Pacman Solver\
\
This project was my Final project for my C++ Data structures course. It implements graphs and breadth-first pathfinding algorithm. The program starts by parsing a txt file and dynamically creating a game board depending on the values in the text file. Then, the ghosts use the nodes on the board to find the shortest path to Pacman. The Pacman find the best path to go on the avoid getting eaten. This project took about 1 1/2 weeks to implement. I hope you like it!}
